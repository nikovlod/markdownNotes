title: | Morphology | Purpuric lesions that display a retiform configuration (net-like pattern). This morphology indicates thrombi formation within the vessels and subsequent cutaneous infarcts.                                                                                                                                                             |

| Blanching  | Purpura results from extravasation of red blood cells into the dermis, meaning the lesions do not blanch with pressure (non-palpable or palpable purpura).                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Mechanism  | Associated with thrombi formation within vessels, distinguishing them from non-inflammatory purpura caused by clotting defects or vascular fragility. Embolic lesions often have an irregular outline, indicative of a cutaneous infarct.                                                                                                |
| Etiologies | The non-inflammatory purpura with a retiform configuration is seen in conditions causing vessel thrombosis, including Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), monoclonal cryoglobulinemia, thrombocytosis, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP), Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome, and reactions to warfarin and heparin (HIT). |

#### üìù Key Differential Points to Remember:

1.  Blanching: The most critical distinction! Livedo reticularis is due to altered flow (blanchable), whereas Retiform purpura is due to vascular occlusion/extravasation (non-blanchable purpura).
2.  Configuration & Severity: While both Livedo reticularis and Livedo racemosa involve a net-like pattern, the latter is irregular and disrupted. Retiform purpura usually signals a severe underlying thrombotic process leading to hemorrhagic infarcts.
3.  Pathophysiology: Livedo reticularis is a vascular phenomenon (slowed flow/vasospasm), while Retiform purpura is a purpuric event caused by vessel thrombi/occlusion.
