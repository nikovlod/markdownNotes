title: Valsalva maneuver
---

The Valsalva manoeuvre is defined as a forced expiration against a closed glottis.

### Physiological Effects

The manoeuvre results in:
*   Increased intrathoracic pressure.
*   An initial rise in venous and right atrial pressure.
*   A reduction in venous return to the heart.
*   A subsequent fall in cardiac output due to reduced preload (Frank-Starling mechanism).

### Clinical Significance

As an acute management vagal manoeuvre, the Valsalva is used to terminate episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Failure to respond to vagal manoeuvres like the Valsalva maneuver typically leads to the use of intravenous adenosine.

It is also important for differentiating cardiac murmurs because it affects preload:
*   **Murmur Intensity:** It typically makes most murmurs quieter (e.g., aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation) due to reduced preload.
*   **Exceptions:** It increases the intensity of murmurs associated with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and mitral valve prolapse. In mitral valve prolapse, the click and murmur move earlier in systole as ventricular volume decreases.

In the context of diagnosing a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO), the Valsalva manoeuvre is used because it increases right atrial pressure, which can cause the PFO to open, allowing venous debris to enter the arterial circulation.
