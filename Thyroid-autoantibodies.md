## Key Thyroid Autoantibodies

Thyroid autoantibodies are primarily directed against thyroid antigens and are essential in determining the etiology of thyroid dysfunction:

1.  **Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb):** These target the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) enzyme. TPO antibodies are the main component previously measured as thyroid 'microsomal' antibodies.
2.  **Antithyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb):** These are directed against thyroglobulin.
3.  **TSH Receptor Antibodies (TRAb):** These antibodies bind to the TSH receptor. They are biologically significant because they can be either **stimulating** (Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin or TSI, causing hyperthyroidism) or **blocking** (causing hypothyroidism).

### Clinical Association and Significance

The pattern of autoantibodies helps distinguish between the major autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD):

| Disease | Primary Antibody Finding | Prevalence/Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis** (Autoimmune Hypothyroidism) | High titres of TPOAb and TgAb | TPOAb are present in 90–100% of autoimmune hypothyroidism cases. |
| **Graves’ Disease** (Hyperthyroidism) | TRAb (specifically TSI) | TRAb are highly specific, found in over 95% of patients with Graves’ disease. TPOAb and TgAb may also be moderately high. |

### Vital Points to Remember

1.  **Aetiology Confirmation:** Measuring thyroid autoantibodies is necessary to confirm an autoimmune cause of thyroid disease.
2.  **Prognostic Role:** In patients with Graves' disease, persistently high TRAb levels indicate a greater likelihood of relapse when antithyroid drug treatment is discontinued. In subclinical hypothyroidism (high TSH, normal T4/T3), the presence of TPO antibodies increases the risk of progression to overt thyroid failure.
3.  **General Presence:** TPO antibodies are quite common, found in 8–27% of the healthy population (particularly older women), though only a minority of these develop overt hypothyroidism.
4.  **Autoimmune Overlap:** Thyroid disease, being an AITD, is frequently associated with other autoimmune disorders, such as Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Addison’s disease, pernicious anaemia, Sjögren’s syndrome, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC).
5.  **Assay Interference:** Remember that thyroglobulin antibodies can interfere with the assay used to monitor serum thyroglobulin (a tumor marker), which is crucial for follow-up in thyroid carcinoma patients.

## How does thyroid peroxidase ab work? 

### Mechanism and Target

Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb) are destructive autoantibodies that target a critical enzyme within the thyroid gland.

1.  **Target Identification:** TPO antibodies are directed against the **Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) enzyme**. Historically, these were the principal components measured as thyroid 'microsomal' antibodies.
2.  **Function:** The TPO enzyme is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones because it organizes iodide (incorporates iodine) into the amino acid tyrosine on thyroglobulin.
3.  **Pathological Action:** The binding of these destructive antibodies contributes to the autoimmune process, which produces inflammation and the ultimate destruction of thyroid tissue. This destruction is characterized histologically by destructive lymphoid infiltration, leading eventually to atrophic change and hypothyroidism.

### Vital Points to Remember

*   **Primary Association:** TPO antibodies are the defining serological marker for **Hashimoto’s thyroiditis** (autoimmune hypothyroidism), found in 90% to 100% of these cases.
*   **Significance:** Measuring autoantibodies is necessary to confirm the autoimmune cause of thyroid disease.
*   **Other Conditions:** TPO antibodies may also be found, sometimes at slight to moderately high levels, in other autoimmune thyroid conditions, such as Graves' disease. However, a positive result for TPO antibodies is considered highly sensitive for autoimmune thyroid disease, though not highly specific for a single disorder, as they are often present in the healthy population as well.
