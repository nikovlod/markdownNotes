title: Difference between Livedo reticularis, Livedo racemosa, Retiform purpura
---

#### 1️⃣ Livedo Reticularis

Livedo Reticularis describes a mottled or rete (netlike) appearance on localized areas of the extremities, manifesting as reddish-to-blue discoloration.

| Feature | Description & Vital Points |
| :--- | :--- |
| Morphology | A mottled reticular vascular pattern that appears as a lace-like, purplish discoloration of the skin. |
| Mechanism | Caused by slowed blood flow through the superficial horizontal venous plexus. It represents localized vasodilatation. |
| Blanching | Blanches with pressure (Diascopy is key here!). |
| Types | Primary/Idiopathic: Typically benign, symmetric, and uniform mottling, often more prominent with cold exposure and improving upon warming. |
| Associations (Secondary) | Can be associated with vasculitides, atheroembolism, hyperviscosity, cryoglobulinemia, Sneddon's syndrome, and Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS). It is also seen with purpuric lesions and painful ulcerations in livedoid vasculopathy. |

#### 2️⃣ Livedo Racemosa

Livedo Racemosa is essentially a specific, irregular form of secondary livedo reticularis.

| Feature          | Description & Vital Points                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Morphology   | Characterized by a broken, irregular, and asymmetric pattern. The mottling is irregular and disrupted.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Blanching    | Unlike the benign form of livedo reticularis, the mottling generally does not improve with warming. (Since it's a form of livedo, it should blanch, but the sources emphasize its irregularity and non-improvement with heat, differentiating it clinically from primary livedo reticularis). |
| Significance | It is the term used to characterize secondary livedo reticularis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Associations | It is a microvascular feature recognized in the clinical domain of Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS).                                                                                                                                                                                               |

#### 3️⃣ Retiform Purpura

Retiform Purpura is not a single diagnosis, but a configuration of non-inflammatory purpura associated with vascular occlusion or thrombi formation.
