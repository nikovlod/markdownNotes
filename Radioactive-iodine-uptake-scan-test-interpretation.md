title: Radioactive iodine uptake scan test interpretation
---

The Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU) test, often performed using I-131 or I-123, measures the proportion of isotope trapped in the thyroid gland. In clinical practice, this technology has been largely superseded by 99mTechnetium scintigraphy scans, which are faster, require a lower dose of radioactivity, and provide a higher-resolution image.

As a diagnostic tool, the interpretation of the uptake pattern is crucial for differentiating the causes of thyrotoxicosis and evaluating thyroid nodules:

### 1. Interpretation in Thyrotoxicosis

The radioactive iodine uptake pattern helps distinguish between intrinsic hyperactivity (high uptake) and inflammation or exogenous sources (low uptake).

| Uptake Pattern | Interpretation/Disease | Specific Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Uptake (Diffuse)** | **Graves’ Disease** (Autoimmune) | Shows diffuse uptake of tracer characterized by rapid uptake and rapid turnover. This means high uptake after 2 or 4 and 24 hours, followed by a rapid fall after 48 hours. |
| **High Uptake (Focal)** | **Toxic Nodule** or Toxic Multinodular Goitre | Shows focal uptake of tracer in the nodule(s), indicating autonomous function. This uptake occurs with reduced or suppressed uptake in the surrounding thyroid tissue. |
| **Low/Minimal Uptake** | **Low-Uptake Thyrotoxicosis** | Characterized by minimal or negligible uptake of tracer. |

### 2. Causes of Low Radioiodine Uptake

When thyrotoxicosis is confirmed but uptake is minimal, the cause is often related to destructive processes or exogenous hormones:

*   **Transient Thyroiditis:** This includes Subacute thyroiditis (De Quervain’s), Postpartum thyroiditis, or viral thyroiditis.
*   **Exogenous/Iatrogenic Sources:** Factitious thyrotoxicosis (ingestion of excessive thyroid hormone, which suppresses pituitary TSH and subsequent iodine uptake).
*   **Iodine Induced:** Administration of iodine (e.g., iodine-containing radiographic contrast media or drugs like amiodarone).
*   **Ectopic Tissue:** Rare causes like ectopic thyroid tissue producing thyrotoxicosis (struma ovarii).

### 3. Interpretation in Nodules

When evaluating thyroid nodules, scans help classify the lesion based on its function:

*   **Hot Nodule (Functioning):** The nodule takes up the radioiodine. This type is rarely malignant.
*   **Cold Nodule (Non-Functioning):** The nodule does not take up the radioiodine. This suggests a 10% likelihood of malignancy.

### Vital Points to Remember

*   **Hashimoto’s Progression:** In Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, uptake is dynamic: initially increased (toxic phase), becoming normal later, and finally showing less uptake (hypothyroid phase).
*   **Malignancy Risk:** Scintigraphy is generally used when TSH is low. If TSH is normal, a "cold" nodule is more likely to be malignant, but note that Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) guided by ultrasound has largely replaced isotope scanning in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules.
*   **Alternative Imaging:** Where TRAb measurement is not available in Graves' disease, radioisotope scanning serves as an alternative diagnostic approach.
