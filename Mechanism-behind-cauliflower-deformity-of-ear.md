title: Mechanism behind cauliflower deformity of ear
---

This ear deformity is known as “Cauliflower ear.”
It occurs due to repeated blunt trauma to the auricle (common in wrestlers, boxers, MMA fighters).

🧠 Mechanism:
•Trauma → Subperichondrial hematoma formation (blood collects between cartilage and perichondrium).
•The hematoma separates the perichondrium from the underlying cartilage → disrupts nutrient supply.
•This leads to cartilage necrosis, fibrosis, and new irregular cartilage formation → permanent ear deformity.
