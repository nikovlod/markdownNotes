title: Hypoglycemic disorder and Whipple triad

## Whipple's Triad

Whipple's triad is the ==gold standard== for documenting hypoglycemia and proving the presence of a hypoglycemic disorder, especially when it is suspected in the absence of relevant drug-treated diabetes.

The triad comprises three essential components:

1.  **Symptoms Consistent with Hypoglycemia:** The patient must present with symptoms indicative of low blood sugar.
2.  **Low Plasma Glucose Concentration:** A low plasma glucose concentration must be measured using a precise method (i.e., blood drawn before glucose administration, if possible).
3.  **Relief of Symptoms After Glucose is Raised:** The symptoms must resolve after the plasma glucose level is raised (either via oral or parenteral glucose, or IV glucagon).

**Vital Points to Remember:**

*   Attribution of symptoms (neurogenic or neuroglycopenic) to hypoglycemia requires demonstration that the plasma glucose is low and that the symptoms resolve upon glucose correction.
*   The confirmation of the hypoglycemic mechanism, achieved through documenting the triad, is critical for selecting appropriate therapeutic strategies to prevent recurrent hypoglycemia.

## Hypoglycemic disorder 

### Definition of a Hypoglycemic Disorder

A **hypoglycemic disorder** is a condition where hypoglycemia occurs, particularly in the absence of diabetes treated with relevant drugs.

The presence of a true hypoglycemic disorder is rigorously established by documenting **Whipple's triad**:
1.  **Symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia**.
2.  A **low plasma glucose concentration** measured accurately.
3.  **Relief of symptoms** after the plasma glucose level is raised.

### Examples of Hypoglycemic Disorders

Hypoglycemia can occur in a seemingly well individual or in a patient who is ill or medicated. When evaluating a patient, especially in the absence of drug-treated diabetes, we categorize the causes to narrow the differential diagnosis.

Here are key examples of disorders associated with hypoglycemia:

#### 1. Endogenous Hyperinsulinism (in seemingly well individuals)
This is a primary $\beta$-cell disorder where insulin secretion fails to fall appropriately during hypoglycemia.

*   **Insulinoma:** An insulin-secreting pancreatic islet $\beta$-cell tumor, which is the prototypical cause of endogenous hyperinsulinism. Weight gain can be a presenting feature of patients with insulinoma, driven by the need to eat frequently to avoid hypoglycemia.
*   **Functional $\beta$-cell disorders:** These include nesidioblastosis ($\beta$-cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia) or noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia.
*   **Post–gastric bypass hypoglycemia:** Most often follows Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and is characterized by diffuse islet involvement and endogenous hyperinsulinism.
*   **Insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia:** Caused by antibodies to insulin (Hirata's syndrome) or, rarely, antibodies to the insulin receptor functioning as an agonist.

#### 2. Critical Illnesses and Organ Failure (in ill or medicated individuals)
These are second only to drugs as causes of hypoglycemia among hospitalized patients.

*   **Hepatic failure:** Rapid and extensive hepatic destruction (e.g., toxic hepatitis) causes fasting hypoglycemia because the liver is the major site of endogenous glucose production.
*   **Renal failure:** Hypoglycemia is caused by reduced clearance of insulin and reduced mobilization of gluconeogenic precursors.
*   **Cardiac failure**.
*   **Sepsis**.
*   **Inanition** (severe malnutrition/starvation).

#### 3. Non–$\beta$-Cell Tumors
Also called non–islet cell tumor hypoglycemia.

*   **Large mesenchymal or epithelial tumors** (e.g., hepatomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, carcinoids).
*   These tumors often secrete an incompletely processed form of insulin-like growth factor II ("big IGF-II").

#### 4. Hormone Deficiencies
These deficiencies make a patient susceptible to hypoglycemia, particularly during prolonged fasting or periods of high glucose utilization.

*   **Cortisol deficiency** (e.g., primary adrenocortical failure/Addison's disease or secondary adrenal insufficiency due to hypopituitarism).
*   **Growth hormone deficiency** (e.g., in hypopituitarism).

#### 5. Inborn Errors of Metabolism (most common in infancy, but can present in adulthood)
*   **Disorders of glycogenolysis** (e.g., Glycogen Storage Diseases, types 0, I, III, and IV, and Fanconi-Bickel syndrome) causing fasting hypoglycemia.
*   **Defects in fatty acid oxidation** (e.g., defects in the carnitine cycle) resulting in fasting hypoglycemia.
*   **Defects in gluconeogenesis** (e.g., fructose-1,6-biphosphatase deficiency).
*   **Postprandial hypoglycemia:** Rare errors including inherited fructose intolerance.

#### 6. Accidental, Surreptitious, or Malicious Hypoglycemia
Often referred to as factitious hypoglycemia, this involves the administration of insulin or an insulin secretagogue by the patient or another party.
