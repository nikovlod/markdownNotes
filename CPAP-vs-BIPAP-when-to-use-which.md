title: CPAP vs BIPAP when to use which

### Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)

CPAP is a non-invasive ventilatory technique that involves the application of a continuous positive airway pressure throughout the patient's entire breathing cycle, typically set between 5–10 cmH₂O.

| Feature | Description & Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Mechanism** | Provides a single, fixed positive pressure during both inspiration and expiration. It helps to recruit collapsed alveoli and maintain lung volume, thereby improving oxygenation and compliance. |
| **Primary Use Cases** | **Oxygenation/Fluid Management (Type I Failure)**: CPAP is particularly effective at treating conditions primarily defined by fluid in the alveoli or lung collapse, such as acute pulmonary oedema (heart failure) and post-operative atelectasis. |
| | **Sleep Apnoea:** It is the standard treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnoea/Hypopnoea Syndrome (OSAHS). |
| **Physiological Advantage** | It is beneficial in Type I respiratory failure, as it improves oxygenation without compounding the hypocapnia (low PaCO₂) that sometimes occurs in this type of failure. |

### Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) / Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV)

BiPAP is a mode of NIV that provides ventilatory support by cycling between two distinct pressures, offering assistance primarily for ventilation (CO₂ clearance).

| Feature | Description & Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Mechanism** | Delivers a higher Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure (IPAP, commonly 15–25 cmH₂O) for inspiration and a lower Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP, usually 4–10 cmH₂O) to allow expiration. This difference in pressure (the driving pressure) reduces the work of breathing and effectively offloads the diaphragm. |
| **Primary Use Cases** | **Ventilatory Failure (Type II Failure):** NIV using BiPAP is the first-line therapy for patients with acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) complicated by mild to moderate respiratory acidosis. It should be offered if a patient has persistent respiratory acidosis with a pH of <7.35. Specific biochemical indications for NIV in COPD exacerbations include a respiratory rate greater than 23 breaths/min, pH <7.35, and PaCO₂ >6.5 kPa. |
| | **Other Indications:** It is also useful in obesity hypoventilation syndromes and some neuromuscular disorders. Home NIV is also used for chronic ventilatory failure in conditions like kyphoscoliosis. |
| **Key Intervention Timing** | It should be initiated early, especially when severe respiratory acidosis secondary to hypercapnia is present. |

### Vital Point to Remember (Which to Choose)

In essence, you use **BiPAP/NIV** primarily for a **ventilation problem** (Type II respiratory failure/CO₂ retention) because the cycling pressure difference actively reduces the work of breathing and helps blow off CO₂. You use **CPAP** primarily for an **oxygenation problem** or to *splint* the airway open (Type I respiratory failure, like pulmonary edema, or OSAHS).
